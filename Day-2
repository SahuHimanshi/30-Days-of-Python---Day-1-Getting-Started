ðŸ“Œ Day 02 â€“ Variables and Data Types
âœ… What I Learned:
Integers (int)

Whole numbers, e.g., 5, -12, 0

Used for counting, indexing, simple arithmetic.

Floats (float)

Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5

Useful for measurements, percentages, precise calculations.

Strings (str)

Text data enclosed in quotes, e.g., "Hello", '123'

Can contain letters, digits, symbols.

Booleans (bool)

Only two values: True or False

Used in conditions and logical operations.

Type Conversion

Changing one data type to another:

int("10") â†’ 10

float("3.5") â†’ 3.5

str(100) â†’ "100"

Important when working with user input (always comes in as a string).
